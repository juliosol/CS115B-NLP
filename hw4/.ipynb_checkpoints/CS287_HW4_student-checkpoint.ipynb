Once you see someone's coding solution, it's nearly impossible to harness that information in a way that you can write your own unique solution. You've been robbed of a learning opportunity and will likely just regurgitate someone else's work. As a reminder, if you want to take a shortcut on any problem by looking online for already-existing solutions, that's permissible, but you must cite your sources. Otherwise, it constitutes cheating.

Keep in mind that LLMs will continue to be developed by a myriad of companies for the foreseeable future (for decades, I'd guess), so this is not a dig at the creators of BERT (Google) or GPT-2 (OpenAI). Let's say you've just graduated from Harvard and are working for a company named Transparent AI (I'm making up this name, so if such a company exists, it's not intentional). You are on a team of 50 people who work on building a LLM, and your specific job is to make an aspect of the model more parallelizable and computationally efficient.\n",

If so, then what are possible actions you should/would take? To be clear, this question isn't asking what technical aspects you would add to the model; it's asking what human-level actions you would take, such as speaking with others, volunteering to do extra engineering work, etc. Please discuss with a minimum of 3 sentences.\n",

    "In this section, we'll experiment with OpenAI's GPT2 model in a song lyric generation task. Like BERT, GPT2 is a *large language model* (LLM), and has\n",
    "achieved historically stunning results on a wide variety of NLP tasks.\n",
    "As in the last homework, because training GPT2 from scratch is \n",
    "infeasible on your laptop, we will borrow the pretrained GPT2 weights published on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/gpt2.html) and finetune them for our downstream task.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will:\n",
    "1. Pick your favorite artists (either from our provided dataset, or feel free to bring your own!)\n",
    "2. Finetune GPT2 on your artists' lyrics\n",
    "3. Generate novel lyrics\n",
    "\n",
    "As before, *we strongly recommend you use Colab for this assignment*. Unless you're one of the lucky few who've managed to snag an RTX 3080 amidst this silicon shortage (or have a similarly beefy GPU on hand), **you will not be able to run this notebook on your local machine.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**DISCLAIMER**: We offer the dataset of lyrics on an as-is basis for pedagogical purposes. We do not support, condone, or affiliate with any problematic messages potentially embedded in this dataset. To view the original source, see [here](https://www.kaggle.com/deepshah16/song-lyrics-dataset).\n",
    "\n",
    "*A side note*: you've probably heard of [GPT3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3), OpenAI's successor to GPT2. So why aren't we using GPT3? For a couple reasons:\n",
    "* The model is ginourmous. It's an order of magnitude *bigger* than GPT2. As you will soon see, Colab's GPUs can barely handle the *smallest* GPT2 model. If we gave you GPT3, we'd need a dedicated datacenter just for this class.\n",
    "* The model is **closed source**. In a rather controversial move, OpenAI awarded Microsoft [exclusive access](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/23/1008729/openai-is-giving-microsoft-exclusive-access-to-its-gpt-3-language-model/) to the model. Researchers can still use a public API to query to the model, but only Microsoft has access to the weights directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past, OpenAI has cited social concerns around releasing GPT3 openly to the public, claiming that GPT3-generated text can be difficult to distinguish from human-authored text. Malicious individuals could, for example, use it to generate large quantities of fake news. Hence, even prior to the Microsoft deal, OpenAI has never openly released the training weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "All that's to say, we won't be able to use GPT3 in the assignment. But if you're curious to learn more, do check out [the original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165).

That means the next time we run this cell, if that memory hasn't been released (and it probably hasn't), PyTorch will try to allocate *another 7GB*, but because there isn't another 7GB free, it will return a `CUDA out of memory` error.
