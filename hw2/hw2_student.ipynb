    "- **Lecture 7:** seq2seq + Attention\n",
    "- **Lecture 8:** Machine Translation\n",
    "\n",
    "Language is inherently sequential in nature, which makes it conducive to models that can capture the contextual, long-range dependencies. Toward this, you will first gain experience working with a simple RNN. The RNN aims to capture the data's meaning in its hidden layer (like all neural models), which will be used toward a classification task (sentiment analysis of IMDb movies).\n",
    "\n",
    "After seeing the effectiveness of this basic model, you will then extend this model for two missions. As a warm-up, we would like you to try your hand on performing sentiment analysis on an IMDB review dataset. Afterwards, your *true* mission, should you accept, is to make a complete Machine Translation system. There are some evil hackers on the Dark Web who are stealing and selling others' personal information, financial documents, CS287 assignments, etc. To make their operation covert, they are speaking in a \"Mystery Language\". Forensics suspect their mystery language is actually one of the following languages:\n",

    "\n",
    "As a heads-up, this assignment is shorter than Homework 1, as we wanted to provide you all with more time to focus on research. This pattern will persist, as each homework assignment will be shorter than the previous. With that said, the models at hand are increasing in complexity, and thus please ensure you allocate sufficient time to building, debugging, and running the models. For example, the last part of Problem 2 (programming) requires you to run your model on 5 different corpora. Our solutions can train the full model in just a few minutes (i.e., 1-5); however, if your solution is overwhelmingly slow, the total running time can start to become a hindrance.\n",

    "If your code runs slowly on your own local machine, you are free to run your code on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) -- just be mindful that the academic policy is still in tact, and that nobody else should have access to your code. In terms of grading, in general, we will not be too picky with the _efficiency_ of your code, unless it's egregious. Having a sound solution is the most important."

    "- <span style=\"background-color: #FFC8C8\"><b>Application (programming):</b></span> gain experience putting that knowledge into practice \n",
    "- <span style=\"background-color: #CAFFBF\"><b>Research (creating new knowledge):</b></span> use your current NLP knowledge and skills to go beyond the course material, to grasp cutting-edge results and to critically accept or challenge that information.

However, no student shall ever discuss their solutions or see another student's solutions to any problem. Once you see someone's coding solution, it's nearly impossible to harness that information in a way that you can write your own unique solution. You've been robbed of a learning opportunity and will likely just regurgitate someone else's work. As a reminder, if you want to take a shortcut on any problem by looking online for already-existing solutions, that's permissible, but you must cite your sources. Otherwise, it constitutes cheating. Posting any pieces of this homework online for others to see if a flagrant violation of our academic policy.\n",

I urge you to critically and earnestly think about your own learning, communicate to us your thoughts, and to optionally tell us possible adjustments we could make so that you meet our learning expectations and you achieve your own learning goals."

    "Now it's time to implement the Encoder class. As usual, we'll extend the `torch.nn.Module` class. Remember that we have to implement the following methods:\n",
    "1. An `__init__()` method which instantializes the `Module` object. Here, we typically save input variables (such as model hyperparameters) and define/instantiate our layers. \n",
    "    - For the LSTM Encoder, we've provided the signature of `__init__()`. \n",
    "    - For simplicity, instantiate a fresh Embedding layer (rather than using existing embeddings)\n",
    "    - No need implement your own LSTM from scratch! For this homework, it suffices to use the PyTorch [LSTM](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.LSTM.html) class. Be sure to read the docs thoroughly to understand the parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A `forward()` method which takes as input (1) a batch of data from the `DataLoader`; and (2) the lengths of each sequence in the batch. The `forward()` method returns a tuple of two tensors: (a) the final hidden state (i.e., \"short-term memory\") and (b) the final cell state (i.e., \"long-term memory\") of the LSTM.\n",
    "\n",
    "In your code for `forward()`, you will need to make use of a function that is important for RNNs: the `torch.nn.utils.rnn` method [`pack_padded_sequence`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.utils.rnn.pack_padded_sequence.html).  To gain some intuition on what this method is doing, see this [StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51030782/why-do-we-pack-the-sequences-in-pytorch/) (especially the diagrams).  There are two reasons why we need `pack_padded_sequence()`:\n",
    "- First, packing saves computation for batch sequences, especially if there is a lot of padding involved. Packing before feeding sequences to an LSTM can speed up computation if there is one sequence in your batch that is much longer than all of the others.\n",
    "- The second, and more important, reason is that packing is used for *extracting the correct hidden state for each element of the batch* after passing the sequence through the LSTM.  Let's say we have $B$ sequences in our batch, and they have lengths $t_1, t_2, \\ldots, t_B$.  The size of `input_seqs` (i.e., the input to `forward()`) will be $B \\times T$, where $T = \\max_{i=1}^B t_i$.  Recall that in LSTMs, a hidden state is generated *for each time step* from $1$ to $T$. However, we want to ensure that for the first element in the batch, we end up extracting the hidden state corresponding to time $t_1$ (and for the second element, $t_2$, and for the third element, $t_3$, etc.). In short, packing helps us achieve this.\n",

    "We are going to build a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) translation system.  Our seq2seq will have two major components: (1) an encoder that maps a source sentence to a tuple of (hidden, cell) vectors and (2) a decoder that uses the (hidden, cell) vectors to generate a translation.  The good news is that the encoder has already been implemented for you -- that is, you did it yourself in the previous problem!  We can simply reuse the `EncoderLSTM` that you used for the text classifier as our encoder; part of the point of this exercise is to illustrate that deep learning enables the use of common architectures for NLP problems that are quite different from one another (e.g. text classification vs. machine translation).\n",

    "- `__init__()`: Defines the layers of our network.  We will need an `Embedding` layer to encode the target vocabulary as vectors and an `LSTM` layer for decoding our target words.\n",

This function will return a tuple of three tensors -- (a) the hidden states of the LSTM for all time steps, (b) the final hidden state of the LSTM, and (c) the final cell state of the LSTM.\n",

    "Now comes the fun part: putting everything together!  Using our `EncoderLSTM` and `DecoderLSTM` blocks, let's implement the `Seq2Seq` model below.  There are three main functions to implement:\n",
    "- `__init__()`: Initializing the `Seq2Seq2` model.  You will need three blocks -- the `EncoderLSTM`, the `DecoderLSTM`, and a `Linear` projection layer to map hidden states of the decoder to the target vocabulary for word prediction.  This final projection layer should be something very familiar to you -- i.e. it serves the same role as the final projection layer in `CBOW` (word2vec) from Homework #1.\n",
    "- `forward()`: This function will be used for training the model.  Machine translation models are typically trained with a concept call *teacher forcing*, in which the ground-truth tokens from the true target translation (dubbed the \"teacher\") are used as context to predict the next word.  Let $B$ be the batch size, $T_i$ be the sequence length for the input sequence, $T_o$ be the sequence length for the output sequence, $V_o$ be the size of the output vocabulary, and $M_o$ be the number of non-pad tokens in `output_seqs`.  Our `forward()` function will take a $B \\times T_i$ `input_seqs` tensor and its corresponding target translation, the $B \\times T_o$ `output_seqs` tensor, and return a tuple of (1) a flattened predictions tensor `preds` of size $M_o \\times V_o$ and (2) a flattened target words tensor `targs` of length $M_o$ (Note: `targs` should not contain any padding indices).   \n",
    "- `generate()`: Recall that in machine translation, training is very different from inference.  In training, we use the `forward()` function to train the model with *teacher forcing*.  However, at inference time, we don't know what the true translation is, so the model must generate the entire target sequence from scratch.  It can do this by first encoding the source sequence with the encoder and then passing the EOS token to the decoder/output_layer to get a probability distribution for the first word.  Then, it can take the most likely token from this probability distribution as the next word.  We can then feed this next word back into the decoder to get the next word after that, until our model generates the EOS token again, telling us the translation is finished.  This is the logic you will implement in the `generate()` function.  For ease of implementation, we won't batch this function.  That is, the argument `source` will be a 1D tensor of size $t_i$ and you will return a 1D translation tensor with maximium length `max_steps`.\n",
