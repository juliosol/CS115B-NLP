20621,"Regardless of ‘Brexit’ Vote, Experts Say, E.U. Must Rethink Status Quo - The New York Times",New York Times,Jim Yardley,2016-06-25,2016.0,6.0,,"ROME  —   Among the   bureaucrats of the European Union, it is an article of faith that the bloc always emerges stronger from a crisis. The idealistic founders who six decades ago dreamed of stitching warring nations into a peaceful whole knew the path would be bumpy. But always, the union wobbled forward. Now the dream of an integrated and   Europe could sink into the English Channel on Thursday, when British voters decide whether to abandon the bloc. To the   establishment, this latest crisis is considered a peculiarly British affair, in which the villains are opportunistic politicians steering voters toward a delusional,   mistake. That may be. But if Britain does leave, the European Union can also blame its own handling of the crises of the past decade  —   the tribulations of the euro, the debt standoff with Greece and a flawed approach to migration. Each time, the bloc rammed through ugly,   fixes that only inflamed the angry nationalism now spreading across the Continent and Britain. The result was almost a decade of ad hoc crisis management that even many admirers agree has left the European Union badly wounded and its reputation badly damaged. Idealism has given way to disillusionment. The bloc’s elite technocrats are often perceived as out of touch, while European institutions are not fully equipped to address problems like unemployment and economic stagnation. Political solidarity is dissolving into regional divisions of east and west, north and south. The economic implications of a British exit, the   Brexit, are potentially staggering, but many experts agree that regardless of how the British vote, politics across Europe must change. The structure of the euro currency zone is still considered fragile. The bloc’s   economic policy has meant nearly a decade lost in much of   southern Europe, which is still struggling to recover from its economic crisis. “We cannot continue with the status quo,” said Enrico Letta, a former Italian prime minister. “We have to move forward. ” Politics in Europe, as in the United States, have gotten ugly and mean.     parties are gaining strength in Poland, Hungary, Austria, France and Germany. That same nasty tenor has infused the British campaign with hostility and xenophobia toward immigrants. The killing on Thursday of Jo Cox, a member of Parliament who had campaigned for remaining in the union, shocked all of Britain. “It is not very easy being English at the moment,” said Simon Tilford, deputy director of the Center for European Reform in London. “Grim stuff. ” Mr. Tilford falls into an interesting camp: He has long been an outspoken critic of the European Union’s handling of its currency woes, yet he strongly supports Britain’s remaining in the bloc. The benefits far outweigh the disadvantages, he argues, even as he realizes that policy failures by the European Union have helped legitimize the arguments of some who want to leave. “It has made it easier for them to portray the E. U. as a failure,” he said. “Lots of people have become euroskeptics in Britain because they are so angry at what has happened in the eurozone in recent years. ” During the 1990s, Britain was already a member of the European Union and was considering whether to drop its currency, the pound, and join the zone of countries adopting the bloc’s new currency, the euro. (Today, 19 of the 28 countries in the European Union share the euro.) But a crisis in the financial markets in 1992 effectively settled the matter as Britain decided not to join other countries changing to the euro. Those skeptical of using a common currency to drive closer integration in Europe have always argued that joining the euro system would limit policy flexibility, such as the ability to devalue the national currency during economic downturns or use deficit spending to encourage growth. And they said problems would inevitably arise because of the stark economic differences among the countries sharing the currency. Each proved true. The economic crisis in   plunged the bloc into a cycle of crises from which it still has not recovered. The disparities among eurozone countries were exposed, and to save the currency, northern countries led by Germany bailed out their desperate southern counterparts. The eurozone became divided between debtors and creditors rather than equal partners. The   solution of austerity economics inflicted heavy punishment on countries like Greece. And Britain, outside the euro, recovered more quickly from the 2008 crisis than did most members of the currency group. The politics also shifted: Germany, the bloc’s economic powerhouse, steadily accrued more political power inside European Union institutions. Resentment gradually followed, especially in Greece, the weakest and most indebted member of the eurozone. Populist anger erupted in January 2015 when Greek voters swept aside the country’s political establishment and elected as prime minister a radical leftist, Alexis Tsipras. Mr. Tsipras promised to end austerity, write down Greek debt and change Europe by leading a clash of ideas against the   consensus. It was political theater, and the Greeks would badly misplay their hand. But what followed was a clash of cultures, not ideas: Union officials refused to budge on Greece’s debt obligations, and after months of negotiation and brinkmanship, Greece nearly collapsed into bankruptcy before acceding to demands from Brussels. The Greek standoff was a demonstration not just of European Union power politics, but also of the bloc’s penchant for muddling through. The bloc agreed on a new bailout package for Greece that most analysts regard as a stopgap solution. Greece’s debt is now higher than before, and analysts warn that another euro crisis could still occur. “There is a lot of criticism of the German way of handling the eurozone,” said Daniela Schwarzer, the director of the Europe Program for the German Marshall Fund in Berlin. “That bleeds into the perception that the European Union is not functioning properly. ” It is this perceived ineffectiveness of mainstream political parties at the European and national levels that has emboldened populist or   parties from the left and the right. Last year,   parties seized on the migration crisis  —   with its images of hundreds of thousands of refugees pouring through Europe  —   to provoke public anxiety. Led by Hungary, some countries began erecting fences to block migrants despite the European Union system of open borders. European leaders struggled to mount a coherent response, and Chancellor Angela Merkel’s popularity plummeted after she opened Germany to Syrian refugees. She has since tightened restrictions and championed a controversial deal with Turkey that has sharply reduced the migrant flow into the Continent. In the British referendum,   forces have sought to drive support for the campaign to leave the union by depicting the Continent as being under invasion from migrants. A campaign poster unveiled last week by Nigel Farage, the U. K. Independence Party leader, showed a parade of   migrants. It was pilloried as blatant xenophobia. But it is little different from the propaganda of   politicians in Hungary or Poland. Should it remain in the bloc, Britain could emerge as a powerful force, with more clout to force the changes that most analysts believe are necessary. Even among top officials, there is a growing recognition that Europe’s political mainstream has misjudged the public appetite for rapid European integration. “The specter of a breakup is haunting Europe,” warned Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, which comprises the heads of state of the bloc’s members. “We need to understand the necessity of the historical moment. ” It is easy to forget that the European Union is an audacious political experiment to wash away the antagonisms of World War II and build a new Europe. Unity required putting aside the ancient rivalry between France and Germany, and binding together countries with different languages, cultures and economies. Generations growing up between the 1980s and the 2000s saw how an expanding Europe brought tangible benefits  —   borderless travel, job and educational mobility within the bloc, rising prosperity. Poorly governed countries came under pressure from Brussels to improve. But as the bloc expanded,   also became more unwieldy. Frictions inevitably arose, and old resentments between member states were never fully scrubbed away. Tensions also increased between European institutions and national governments over sovereignty. This has meant little political space for the deep reforms  —   and possible further integration of political powers  —   that some advocates say are needed in Brussels. Many analysts say that even if Britain remains in the bloc, the likelihood of the union’s undertaking significant political reforms is slim until after the national elections in France and Germany in 2017. Doing something bold in Brussels before then could spur an electoral backlash. So the European Union will wait to see what Britain does, and then, possibly, wait some more. “What has happened to you, the Europe of humanism, the champion of human rights, democracy and freedom?” Pope Francis asked last month during his acceptance speech for the Charlemagne Prize, awarded for service toward European unification. He added, “What has happened to you, Europe, the mother of peoples and nations, the mother of great men and women who upheld, and even sacrificed their lives for, the dignity of their brothers and sisters?”"
84549,Paul Ryan says he’ll vote for Trump,Fox News,,2016-06-02,2016.0,6.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160603001640/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/06/02/paul-ryan-says-hell-vote-for-donald-trump-for-president.html?intcmp=hplnws
"," House Speaker Paul Ryan said Thursday he would vote for presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, an announcement his office said amounts to an endorsement.  Ryan,  . made the announcement in a column for the Janesville Gazette, the speaker’s hometown paper, and also tweeted out his voting preference. I’ll be voting for @realDonaldTrump this fall. I’m confident he will help turn the House GOP’s agenda into laws. https:  .  Ryan’s support for Trump ends any speculation about whether or not Ryan would back the likely Republican nominee. Ryan had held off issuing a formal endorsement or saying he would vote for the business magnate even after Trump had appeared to gain the number of delegates needed to win the Republican nomination and all of his primary opponents had suspended their campaigns. Though Ryan on Thursday seemed to stop short of the   endorsement, his office clarified that he was in fact getting behind Trump. ”We’re not playing word games, feel free to call it an endorsement,” Ryan’s chief communications adviser Brendan Buck tweeted. We’re not playing word games, feel free to call it an endorsement. Ryan wrote that conversations he had with Trump on various issues  —   including whether a President Trump would help enact the House GOP agenda  —   helped seal his support.

See Latest Coverage → “Through these conversations, I feel confident he would help us turn the ideas in this agenda into laws to help improve people’s lives,” Ryan wrote. “That’s why I’ll be voting for him this fall. ” The Wisconsin representative acknowledged that he and Trump have been at odds in the past. “It’s no secret that he and I have our differences,” Ryan wrote. “I won’t pretend otherwise. And when I feel the need to, I’ll continue to speak my mind. But the reality is, on the issues that make up our agenda, we have more common ground than disagreement.” Ryan had criticized Trump during the campaign on a range of statements made by the New York billionaire, including a proposed ban on Muslims entering the U. S. The two men held a private summit in May in Washington but Ryan stopped short of backing Trump after the    meeting. But Ryan’s support for Trump was inevitable, Fox News was told weeks ago. The news comes as Ryan begins rolling out a series of six policy initiatives during the next several weeks    none of which are expected to be considered in the current Congress. Ryan made his announcement just as likely Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton was about to deliver a   foreign policy speech. But Buck said the timing was merely happenstance. ”And no, while a fun coincidence, it wasn’t timed to a Hillary Clinton speech,” Buck tweeted. ”Believe it or not, we don’t follow her sched that closely.” An aide to Ryan tweeted that a video would be forthcoming of Ryan talking about his support for Trump.

189782,Zika sex research begins despite U.S. Congress funding impasse,Reuters,Bill Berkrot,2016-06-30,2016.0,6.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-health-zika-sex-idUSKCN0ZG0CW  ,"In the meantime, health officials have warned couples to refrain from unprotected sex for six months after a male partner is infected. The extraordinary recommendation, based on a single report of Zika surviving 62 days in semen, could affect millions. The grave risks associated with Zika, along with its potential reach, are driving U. S. health authorities to pursue research even though funding is mired in Congressional gridlock. A study of sexual transmission risk is one example of science that health officials said can’t wait for politics. Borrowing money earmarked for other programs, the U. S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has started enrolling men infected with Zika in Brazil and Colombia in the study to determine how long the virus remains transmittable in semen. The study could take years to complete, but interim results could help public health officials   their recommendations on sex. ”We are going out on a limb, but we have to,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U. S. institute, said in an interview. ”We can’t say we’re going to wait until we get all the money. ” Public health officials are alarmed by Zika’s transmission versatility, which has the potential to expand its reach. It is primarily spread by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, as are the dengue and chikungunya viruses. But at least 10 countries, including the United States and France, have reported Zika infections in people who had not traveled to an outbreak area but whose sexual partners had. This ability to spread through sex could help Zika gain a further foothold outside the warm habitats of its most effective agent, the mosquito.     CAUTION IN LIEU OF ANSWERS To protect women who are pregnant or trying to conceive, the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended couples refrain from unprotected sex for six months   triple the 62 days the virus survived in the semen in one British case study. The World Health Organization recently issued similar guidance. But such strict advice is not ideal, Dr. Anne Schuchat, a CDC deputy director, said in an interview. ”To tell people not to have sex until we get back to you is not a very satisfying recommendation,” she said. ”We would like to have some more understanding of the sexual risk.” In the U. S. territory of Puerto Rico, where more than 2, 100 cases of infection have been reported since the start of the year, health officials are passing out Zika protection kits that include bug spray and condoms, along with the recommendation. But the warning against unprotected sex isn’t going over very well, said Dr. Chris Prue, a CDC behavioral scientist who has studied the response. ”Condoms are not popular in a lot places,” she said. ”There’s religious and personal preferences and lots of personal factors in that.” U. S. lawmakers deadlocked over funding to fight the Zika virus on Tuesday, as Senate Democrats blocked a Republican proposal they said fell short of the challenge posed by the virus and hurt other health priorities. It was unclear when Congress would revisit the request by President Barack Obama for $1. 9 billion. FUNDING PRIORITIES In the meantime, the White House has diverted more than $500 million earmarked for other projects for urgent Zika initiatives, including those where scientific opportunities will be lost if not acted upon immediately. One such study will follow children born to women infected with Zika to identify the development of any disabilities not detected at birth. Other projects on the priority list include vaccine development and mosquito eradication.    One study underway will assess whether the risk of transmission is greater from men who experience Zika infection symptoms, such as fever and rash, than from those who don’t. This information is considered vital since most people experience no symptoms. The study of infected men in Brazil and Colombia will test semen from thousands of men over time to determine how long Zika poses a risk to sexual partners. As long the virus can be grown in a laboratory from semen cell samples, infectious disease experts believe it is potentially contagious. Zika typically clears the bloodstream about a week after infection, but it has been detected in urine for at least twice as long. Its persistence in semen in the British case study has caused some researchers to draw comparisons to other viruses. HIV can last in blood and semen indefinitely, and the   West Nile virus can reside in the kidneys and urine for years, researchers said. One patient who survived the deadly Ebola outbreak had evidence of that virus in his semen for 18 months. ”We got very surprised by Ebola that it was hanging around for so long,” said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. ”One of the big questions we have to ask is does Zika also cause a similar type of latency?”  (Additional reporting by Julie Steenhuysen; Editing by Michele Gershberg and Lisa Girion) CHICAGO The fate of a spending plan and tax hike aimed at ending Illinois’ unprecedented   budget impasse moved on Tuesday to the   House of Representatives, which will seek to enact the legislation by overriding the Republican governor’s vetoes. New Jersey and Maine ended partial government shutdowns just in time for the Fourth of July holiday on Tuesday, helping New Jersey Governor Chris Christie move past the embarrassment of being photographed on a beach that had been closed to the public.
