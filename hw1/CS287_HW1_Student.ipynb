    "You will gain experience with some of the simple yet highly powerful, foundational techniques that dominated NLP before the recent Deep Learning revolution. All of the core concepts behind these earlier approaches (e.g., `BoW`, `TF-IDF`, and `n-grams`) are still relevant and strongly intertwined within the modern, deep learning advances. For example, learning how to (a) _represent_ language on a fine-grain scale (e.g., words) and coarse-grain (e.g., documents); and (b) _model_ language are still the crux of all NLP systems -- but using deep neural networks to do so currently yield the best results to date. This material serves as the backbone for all future work in the course. Moreover, `word2vec` (2013) provides a segue to deep learning, as it was the first, revolutionary neural model in NLP that yielded profound results. It was the catalyst for the deep learning era, and it opened everyone's eyes to the incredible potential of using neural networks for language... again.\n",

The 'relatedness' score is calculated by representing each document as a TF-IDF embedding, and then we compute the cosine similarity score between it and every other document vector. The app thus has a score for every pairwise combination of documents, and these can be visualized on the screen as a fully-connected graph with edges' lengths being shorter for documents that are more similar to one another.\n",

    "Before giving my answer, we are assuming that, even if there is an issue with some document parsing, we have the same vocabulary for all the documents (regardless of whether the doc had a parsing issue or not).\n",
    "\n",
    "1) With the parsing issue, now for the documents that we only see the abstract section, the term frequencies for the words in these documents are very small and there are a lot of terms that have a TF value of 0, actually. Thus, this implies that the TF-IDF vectors for these documents are very sparse. Thus, this would cause that when we compute the cosine similarity between the embedding vector of a document that was correctly parsed and the embedding of a document that was not correctly parsed, where the documents are closely related, the cosine similarity is smaller than it should be because of the sparseness of the embedding of the badly parsed document. Thus, in this sense, the app will be putting documents (when some of them were badly parsed) that might be very related further away from each other in the graph because the embedding vectors are sparse.   \n",
    "2) I think that long documents would have more accurate document neighbors. Related to what I explained above, the abstract-only documents have very sparse embeddings and so we do lose a lot of information in these embeddings. WHen we compute cosine similarity between any long document embedding and an abstract-only embedding (even though the two documents are very related), the sparseness of the abstract-only embedding will cause that the cosine-similarity of these embeddings is much smaller than it should be. Thus, we will have more accuracy in defining the neighbors of a document when we have the long documents and the embeddings of them compared to have abstract-only documents. "

Since it appears exactly once and we want to consider a bigram, then that implies that we must have some word $w'$ after it. Since the word $w$ happens only once, the pair $w,w'$ happens only once in the whole corpus.

    "In this programming exercise, we will build a very simple, make-shift \"search engine\" called Mini-Google, or Mooogle for short (cows love it). I'm putting \"search engine\" in quotes because clearly a fully-functioning, effective search engine requires a full host of computer science solutions; although NLP and Information Retrieval (IR) serve as the crux for any powerful search engine, one must also make heavy use of databases, distributed systems, security, data structures and algorithms, human-computer interaction (HCI), etc. Nonetheless, here, you will get a flavor of the work by building a barebones system that illustrates the power and limitations of document-level representations (e.g., `BoW` and `TF-IDF`) and basic word-level representations (e.g., `word2vec` embeddings).\n",

    "    - Fox \"News\" (politically conservative)\n",

    "The first step in any NLP pipeline is **tokenization**. Remember, tokenization is the process of taking a string of text (e.g. sentence, paragraph, document) and splitting it up into meaningful sub-units (e.g., words). This will allow models to process and understand text in the way that humans do -- i.e. one word at a time.\n",

However, for this first problem set, we find it most instructive to write the tokenizer from scratch. This will allow us to develop an appreciation of what takes place \"under the hood\" of these great libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our tokenizer will involve the following three steps:\n",
    "- **Lowercasing**: converts all text to lowercase (e.g. `\"The cat ate the fish.\"` -> `\"the cat ate the fish.\"`).  It will allow models to recognize that the first `\"The\"` in the sentence and the second `\"the\"` in the sentence are actually the same word.  \n",
    "- **Punctuation removal**: deletes punctuation (e.g. `\"the cat ate the fish.\"` -> `\"the cat ate the fish\"`) so that characters such as `\".\"`, `\"!\"`, `\"?\"`, etc. not recognized as part of any word. \n",
    "- **Whitespace-splitting**: takes a string of text and segments out the words as a list of strings based on whitespace (e.g. `\"the cat ate the fish\"` -> `[\"the\", \"cat\", \"ate\", \"the\", \"fish\"]`).  "

This was deliberate, as it illustrates how it can be difficult to anticipate all of the nuanced characters and situations that one may encounter in raw text. This is exacerbated by having multiple character encodings. Thus, in practice, it can take a long time to write from scratch a parser that perfectly parses (e.g., tokenizes) your desired input data. As mentioned, fortunately many popular libraries (e.g. [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.tokenize.html), [SpaCy](https://spacy.io/api/tokenizer), [Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/text/Tokenizer)) have their own tokenization functions, which often works sufficiently well for one's data."

    "Great! Now that we have vector representations of all of our _documents_ (not titles of documents), let's see what we can do with them! To quantify the distance between two documents, we will calculate the **cosine similarity** between their vector representations. Imagine that someone is using Mooogle and really likes a particular document $d$. One easy way for Mooogle to recommend documents that are similar to $d$ is to find $k$ documents in the rest of the corpus that have the largest cosine similarity with $d$. Below, write code however you wish so that you can answer the following questions about the full `CS287_news_full.csv` corpus:\n",
    "1. What is the cosine similarity between the following pairs of documents: 20153 and 23299?\n",
    "2. What are the *titles* of the $k = 5$ documents most similar to document 23266? Do these results seem reasonable?\n",
    "3. Explore the corpus a bit.  Are there documents that are close to many different documents? Are there documents that are far from all other documents? **NOTE:** We are not asking/requiring you to make visualizations here; you can if you want, as that would be highly insightful, but we are simply asking for you to explore your results a bit and report your thoughts.\n",

    "From the dataframes above we can see that there quite a few documents that are close to many different documents, in the second dataframe we can see that documents 20643, 20485, 25804, 20510 (and probably more) are very very close to other documents since already they have a cosine similarity of 75% or more wit more than 75% of the documents. On the contrary, from the first dataframe of summary statistics, we can see that document 84570 is very far away from most other documents since it has an average cosine similarity of 1.5665% and the 75% highest cosine similarity with other document is 1.8851%, which tells us that it is far away from most other documents."

I say this because in the recommendations for document 1 and 2, the recommendations of TFIDF are much more related in terms of topic to the queried document than the BoW recommendations. In the first query,  the TFIDF recommendations are all related to texas (or forts) in some way whereas the BoW recommendations  are not related to texas in any way. For the recommendations in the 2nd query, the queried document is about Muhammad Ali and the TFIDF recommendations are mostly all about Muhammad Ali whereas the BoW recommendations are not related to this topic at all.

    "The TF-IDF and BoW recommendations are different because of the way the embedding are built. The BoW recommendations ($\\mathcal{S}$) are based on the BoW embeddings which are formed mostly on how many times a word appears in a document. Thus, computing the cosine similarity metric between BoW embeddings mostly considers documents to be similar if they have similar words and in the same account within it. In comparison, the TFIDF recommendations ($\\mathcal{T}$) are based on the TFIDF embedding which are obtained by multiplying the word frequency in a document by the Inverse Document Frequency (roughly a measure of in how many documents the word appears). With these TFIDF embeddings, the embeddings somehow incorporate information of in how many documents a word appears, thus we are adding also some global information of the words with respect to the documents in the corpus. Thus adding this additional information of the words (w.r.t to the corpus) the TFIDF embeddings encompass different embeddings that in the end generate different cosine similarity compared to the BoW embeddings."

Recall that there are three natural divisions in our dataset, based on news source (i.e. New York Times, Reuters, Fox News). Can TF-IDF encode the political differences between these news sources? To answer this question, in the cell below: use the [Sci-Kit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html) library to run a **principal components analysis** (PCA), and extract the two directions of maximum variation among the TF-IDF vectors.

    "In the plot above we are plotting the TF-IDF embedding vectors for each document and color them based on the newspaper they were published in. From the distribution of the plots, we can see that there is some overlap between Reuters news and Fox News and New York Times. However, ther are significantly more NYT articles spread on the x-axis than Reuters news or Fox News. Additionally, even though there is quite a number of spread articles from Fox across they axis,it seems the majority of them are on the y-axis and the same with Reuters. This shows that there is some distinction in the embeddings of the documents depending on their source but there is no clear distinction between them. This makes sense since no matter if the newspaper is considered to be left, right or center in the political spectrum, they are still reporting the same stories (or at least of the same facts) and so there is bound to be some similarity between the vector embeddings, up to a certain degree, and thats why we see the embeddings clumped together and not cleanly separated."

    "### Word Representations\n",
    "So far, we have only considered how vectors can encode similarity at the document level. However, for decades, researchers have aspired to have useful, meaningful _word-level_ representations, too. After all, much of human language is built on piecing together words that have individual, semantic meaning. Thus, it makes sense for models to also try to capture this phenomenon. In 2013, `word2vec` was created, and not only did it yield the most compelling word-level representations to date, but it was the first, main deep learning architecture in NLP that had undeniably strong results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### PyTorch\n",
    "Back in 2013, deep learning frameworks (e.g., Theono, Caffe, Torch) existed, but they were difficult to use and had orders of magnitude fewer users/contributors than today. With the power of modern-day PyTorch, we will train word-level representations from scratch on our full news corpus. As we will see, even though we are using a relatively small dataset, we will still be able to do some useful reasoning with the word vectors we obtain.  Part of the purpose of this problem is to introduce you to PyTorch's excellent abstractions (e.g. `Dataset`, `DataLoader`, `Module`, `Optimizer`, etc.). Thus, even though the `word2vec` model that we consider here is a simpler version than the ones provided in third-party libraries, our comprehensive, from-scratch approach is more scalable to future problem sets that involve more complex models (e.g. large language models, neural translation models) -- especially when GPUs are involved.\n",

    "Let's start by defining a custom PyTorch dataset class for our news corpus. We will call it the `MooogleDataset`.  Notice in the cell below that it extends the base PyTorch `Dataset`. As a subclass of `Dataset`, `MooogleDataset` is required by contract to implement three methods (you can read more about this [here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/data_tutorial.html)):\n",
    "- A `__init__` method that inputs and stores all the instance variables needed for creating a particular `MooogleDataset` object. As an example, we have implemented this function for you below to take in three arguments:\n",
    "    - the dictionary `tokenized_texts`\n",
    "    - the dictionary `vocab`,\n",
    "    - and an integer `vocab_size`. This will limit the number of unique words that our model is exposed to by only considering the `vocab_size`-most frequent words. Having such a cutoff is standard in deep learning, so that models do not become too large. We will use `vocab_size = 5000`.  Feel free to modify/extend the code in `__init__` if you think that will make implementing the next two functions easier. **Pro tip:** whenever you start to write _any_ code, it's good practice to start small just to ensure everything interacts and behaves correctly -- only once you're sure of such is it worth scaling up and validating the quality of your code. \n",
    "- A `__len__` method that tells us how large the dataset is. In our case, this should be the number of documents in the corpus. You need to implement this method.\n",
    "- A `__getitem__` method that gets a particular item in the dataset. You need to implement this method. The input is `idx`, which is an integer between 0 (inclusive) and the length of the dataset determined by `__len__` (exclusive).  Given `idx`, we want `__getitem__` to (a) find the `idx`-th document (when the documents are sorted in order by id) and (b) return the *integer representation* of that document wrapped in a PyTorch [`Tensor`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html).  Words with vocabulary indices greater than `vocab_size - 1` are ignored. For example consider the document `[\"the\", \"cat\", \"ate\", \"the\", \"yummy\", \"fish\"]` with vocabulary `{\"the\": 0, \"ate\": 1, \"cat\": 2, \"fish\": 3, \"yummy\": 4}` and `vocab_size = 4`.  Then, the *integer representation* of the document is `[0, 2, 1, 0, 3]`, since \"the\"=0, \"cat\"=2, \"ate\"=1, \"the\"=0, \"yummy\"=3, and \"fish\"=2, but \"yummy\" is ignored (i.e., dropped) since its vocabulary index exceeds `vocab_size - 1`.\n",

    "Congrats on making it this far! Now comes the most fun part yet: **implementing the Word2Vec model**. Recall that in the [original Word2Vec paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3781.pdf), there were two ways that Word2Vec vectors could be trained (CBOW and skip-gram). We will be implementing the first method, called **Continuous Bag-of-Words** (CBOW). You can find a diagram of CBOW below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CBOW Training Algorithm:** We will train a vector (also called an \"embedding\") $x_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^D$ for each word $i$ in our vocabulary of size $V$, where $D = 100$ is the size of the vector. To train the embeddings, we will use the documents from our news corpus. Here's the overall process of what we will do:\n",
    "1. Assume we have a document $d$ of length $T$ represented by a sequence of words $w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_T$.  For each word $w_t$ in this document, we will try to predict $w_t$ based on its surrounding words (also known as its \"context\") $\\mathcal{C}_t = \\{w_{t - N}, \\ldots, w_{t - 1}, w_{t +1} \\ldots, w_{t + N}\\}$, where $N = 5$ denotes the context length (meaning the full context will include the 5 words that preceed our given word, and the 5 words that follow it).\n",
    "2. Compute the \"context embedding\" $x = \\frac{1}{2N} \\sum_{w \\in \\mathcal{C}_t} x_w$ by averaging the word embeddings of all words in the context.  Note that this averaging is done for each dimension of the embedding, so $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^D$.  Also note that this averaging will eliminate any notion of word order among words in the context, hence \"continuous bag-of-words\".   \n",
    "3. Use $x$ as the feature vector in a multi-class logistic regression (softmax) problem to predict the missing word $w_t$ out of $V$ possible words in our vocabulary. \n",
    "4. Optimize the word embeddings to minimize the logistic regression loss with batch gradient descent.\n",

    "To implement CBOW in PyTorch, we will extend the ``Module`` class (see below).  If you are new to PyTorch, it is expected that this part will be challenging, so don't worry if it takes you a lot of time to get a working implementation.  Definitely check out the excellent PyTorch tutorial on ``Module`` [here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/buildmodel_tutorial.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class='q_pink'><b>2.4d The CBOW Module [20 points]</b>\n",
    "    \n",
    "All models in PyTorch are implemented through the ``Module`` class.  Below, write a custom ``Module`` called ``CBOW`` that accomplishes the CBOW algorithm we outlined above. Note, every ``Module`` needs to implement the following two methods:\n",
    "1. An ``__init__()`` method that initializes the ``Module`` object.  This ``__init__()`` method typically involves three things: (a) Inputing and saving instance variables (similar to what we did in ``MooogleDataset`` above), (b) Defining the layers/architecture of the network based on these instance variables, and (c) Initializing the layers of the network. \n",
    "    - For ``CBOW``, we have supplied the signature of the ``__init__()`` method, which includes the instance variables you'll need (e.g. ``context_size``, ``vocab_size``, etc.); your job is to accomplish (a), (b), and (c).  For step (b), you can find a list of PyTorch layers [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html) [hint: check out ``Embedding`` and ``Linear`` in particular].  For step (c), you can find PyTorch functions for initializing tensors [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.init.html).  **We highly recommend initializing all word vectors as zero vectors and the logistic regression weights uniformly between -1 and +1.**    \n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "2. A ``forward()`` method that takes a `batch` of data from the `DataLoader` and returns a tuple of two tensors: (a) a tensor of predictions `preds` and (b) tensor of targets `targets`.  \n",
    "    - For ``CBOW``, the input `batch` is a 2D `LongTensor` (i.e. tensor of integers).  It has dimensions $B \\times T$, where $B$ is the batch size and $T$ is the sequence length (i.e. number of words).  Keep in mind that many rows in `batch` will end with a string of -1's to indicate padding.  \n",
    "    - The first output `preds` is expected to be a 2D `FloatTensor` (i.e. tensor of decimals) with dimensions $M \\times V$, where $M$ is the number of (non-pad) words in the batch and $V$ is the size of the vocabulary.  The $(i, j)$-th entry of `preds` will contain CBOW's predicted *log probability* of the $i$-th word in the batch being equal to the $j$-th word in the vocabulary.  \n",
    "    - The second output `targets` is expected to be a 1D `LongTensor` with length $M$.  The $i$-th entry of `targets` will contain the true identity (i.e. \"target\") of the $i$-th word in the batch.\n",
    "    - Writing a `forward()` method that goes directly from `batch` to (`preds`, `targets`) may be quite a challenging task, so we have broken down the problem into subproblems that may be easier to think about.  Each subproblem will involve implementing a different *helper function* (see cell below) that can be used to implement by full `forward()` method.  We encourage you to test your helper functions with sample inputs as you implement them [hint: recall that you can get a sample batch from any `DataLoader` object `dataloader` by running `batch = next(iter(dataloader))`].\n",
    "        - *Subproblem 1*: Following the **CBOW Training Algorithm** above, the first step is to take the batch of documents ``batch`` along with some integer ``context_size`` and extract a ``contexts`` tensor and a ``targets`` tensor.  This logic will be implemented in the ``split_data()`` helper function below [hint: you may want to make use of [this PyTorch function](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.Tensor.unfold.html) in your implementation].  Since each batch has multiple documents, each document has multiple contexts, and each context is comprised of multiple words, ``contexts`` will be a 3D tensor with dimensions $B \\times C \\times N$, where $C$ is the number of contexts [hint: $C$ is a function of $T$ and $N$].  The `targets` tensor will be a 2D tensor with dimensions $B \\times C$, since each context has one target word to predict.  In future steps, we will be using the ``contexts`` to predict the ``targets`` (think of ``contexts`` as the \"X-variable\" and ``targets`` as the \"y-variable\" in logistic regression).  \n",
    "        - *Subproblem 2*: The next step has more to do with tensor organization than the actual CBOW algorithm.  If you look inside your ``contexts`` and ``targets`` tensors from the previous subproblem, you'll notice that some of these contain $-1$, which corresponds to padding.  These exist because we needed to pad some of the documents in order to process them as a batch with common sequence length $T$.  However, we don't actually want to train our model on any contexts or targets that contain padding; padding has nothing to do with the CBOW algorithm.  Thus, to filter out the pads, you will flatten the 3D `contexts` tensor and 2D `targets` tensor by implementing the `flatten_tensors()` helper function below.  The outputs should be a flattened 2D `contexts` tensor with dimensions $M \\times N$ and a flattened 1D `targets` tensor with dimension $M$, where $M$ is the total number of real (i.e. non-pad) words in the batch [hint: to check your understanding, think about why it must be the case that $M < B \\cdot C$].\n",
    "        - *Subproblem 3*: Assuming that you have implemented both `split_data()` and `flatten_tensors()` correctly, you are now ready to write the `CBOW.forward` method, which will call both of these helpers.  The output of `flatten_tensors()` will yield `contexts` and `targets`.  Following the description of the **CBOW Training Algorithm** above, figure out how to pass `contexts` through the layers you defined in ``CBOW.__init__`` to yield ``preds``, the log probabilities tensor of size $M \\times V$.  Then, return ``preds`` and ``targets`` to finish the function.\n",

In particular, we can see that for the words 'man', 'thursday', 'senate', 'jersey', 'injured', 'republican' there are at least 2 (sometimes 3) words that are clearly related to them. The words related with each of the previous ones change after each iteration, but in general, we can see that for the word \"thursday\" we see at least 4 very related words (days of theweek), for \"man\" we usually see \"woman\" or \"boy\", for \"jersey\" we tend to see at least 2 names of cities/countries and same for \"injured\", we see words related to accidents. We expected these results since our network show a loss that was decreasing and after inspecting the inputs in our network, every piece was moving as expected. "

    "## My answer\n",
    "\n",
    "For the results above we see that overall the TF-IDF recommendations are in general better than the Doc2Vec (D2V) recommendations. I say this because for the first query, the D2V recommendations all are related to a gunman and shooter in Florida but the recommendations miss the part that the in the query the shooter showed support from Islamist groups and so none of the recommendations were related to this religion. In the case of the 2nd and 3rd query, the recommendations from D2V are pretty mcuh not related to the query at all. In comparison,k The TF-IDF recommendation sin the first and third query are somewhat related to the query. In particular, in the first query, all the TF-IDF recommendations ar related to a Flroida/orlando gunman and top ofthat there is a recommendation of a storie showing some relation between the shooter and ISIS and Isamic extremism. This shows, that at least for the first query, the TF-IDF recommendations are superior to the D2V recommendations. For the third query, the TF-IDF recommendations are somewhat related to the query, ther are recommendations on a story about Kenya, about hunting, about gorillas, about blackouts and even Obama's family (which is frmo Kenya I believe). This is far superior to the recommendations from the Doc2Vec. In the second query, both recommendations are equally bad. This leads us to conclude that the TF-IDF recommendations are better than the Doc2Vec. In general, I believe TF-IDF embeddings are better because these embeddings are in some sense considering the frequency of words in a document and relates these frequencies to how much a word appears in all the documents. Thus, in some sense, we have an embedding where the entries quantitify a measure of how frequently a word appears in the document (weighted by a measure of much that word appears in all the documents), which intuitively seems more useful to find related documents since intuitivelythe embeddings of related documents might have similar words with similar high measures appearing in the embeddings. In comparison, the D2V embeddings are averages of the word embeddings that appear in that document. By taking the average of the word embeddings, we might be washing off the signal that specific words might be given in that document and so when we want to relate different D2V embeddings we are basically trying to relate random numbers obtained from the average of the embedddings. Because of this reasoning and the results from the query above,we can say that the D2V recommendations were not very good.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively to just the average of the Word2Vec embeddings, to obtain an embedding for the documents we can consider stacking all the words embeddings in a matrix for each document and perhaps we could measure the distance between matrices using matrix norms. This might give better results in terms of similarities of docs but might have an additional computational burden.\n",

    "As we build a foundation in NLP, it's also important to also see what the latest, cutting-edge work (research) looks like. It's incredibly worthwhile to learn about the types of problems people work on, their methodology and approach to the problem, the datasets they work on, the issues they raise, and the solutions they posit. The field moves incredibly fast, but the __approach__ to ML/NLP research is relatively stable -- different types of papers are accepted as the years progress, but that's a different story.\n",

    "The main changes in regular NMT models come in the development of new Loss functions and the deveopment of the Margin between NMT and LM. Thus they use a Transformer (based on Vaswani et.al. 2017), keeping the architecture close to the original one but replacing the decoder of the transformer with the LM architecture and ecluding some cross-attention layers. Furthermore, to reduce the number of parameters, they shared the embedding layer and pre-softmax linear transformation of the transformer with the NMT model. The authors used this model because this one of the benchmark models in NMT and so any improvements designed in this problem need to surpass the results obtain with the vanilla Transformer.|"

In particular, the authors studied the performance of pre-trained MLM (like BERT or BoW-BERT) on a collection of English-language undertsanding benchmarks (GLUE). In particular, the researchers defined two new metrics to investigate the resiliency fo the MLM models to shuffle input: Token Idenfitifiability (which measures the similarity of BERT's represtnation of a word token in a sentence $x$ and the token in its shuffled counter part $x'$, and Self attention distanc which measures if BERT attends to similar tokens for each token in $x$ and its shuffled version $x'$ regardless of the order. Additionally, besides testing BERT on the GLUE tasks, the authors did a test of classification on sensitive texts using differential privacy models.\n",
