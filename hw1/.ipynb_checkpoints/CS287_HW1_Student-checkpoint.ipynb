    "- **Lecture 1:** Course Overview + Intro to NLP\n",
    "- **Lecture 2:** Representations: BoW and TF-IDF \n",
    "- **Lecture 3:** Language Models: n-grams\n",
    "- **Lecture 4:** word2vec\n",
    "\n",
    "You will gain experience with some of the simple yet highly powerful, foundational techniques that dominated NLP before the recent Deep Learning revolution. All of the core concepts behind these earlier approaches (e.g., `BoW`, `TF-IDF`, and `n-grams`) are still relevant and strongly intertwined within the modern, deep learning advances. For example, learning how to (a) _represent_ language on a fine-grain scale (e.g., words) and coarse-grain (e.g., documents); and (b) _model_ language are still the crux of all NLP systems -- but using deep neural networks to do so currently yield the best results to date. This material serves as the backbone for all future work in the course. Moreover, `word2vec` (2013) provides a segue to deep learning, as it was the first, revolutionary neural model in NLP that yielded profound results. It was the catalyst for the deep learning era, and it opened everyone's eyes to the incredible potential of using neural networks for language... again.\n",

I'm putting \"search engine\" in quotes because clearly a fully-functioning, effective search engine requires a full host of computer science solutions; although NLP and Information Retrieval (IR) serve as the crux for any powerful search engine, one must also make heavy use of databases, distributed systems, security, data structures and algorithms, human-computer interaction (HCI), etc. Nonetheless, here, you will get a flavor of the work by building a barebones system that illustrates the power and limitations of document-level representations (e.g., `BoW` and `TF-IDF`) and basic word-level representations (e.g., `word2vec` embeddings).\n",
    "\n",
    "### DATA\n",
    "\n",
    "For Mooogle, we have created two datasets for you to use:\n",
    "- `CS287_news_full` which contains approximately 1000 documents from June 2016 and serves as the full corpus. The documents come from one of three news sources:\n",
    "    - New York Times articles (politically liberal)\n",
    "    - Reuters (politically neutral)\n",
    "    - Fox \"News\" (politically conservative)\n",
    "- `CS287_news_sample` which contains just 3 documents sampled from the full corpus. This serves as a toy example for you to do sanity checks. The documents consist of just 1 document from each of NYT, APNews, and Fox.\n",
    "\n",
    "### PANDAS\n",
    "In all homework assignments, including this one, you are free to use `Pandas`. You are not required to use it at all, but it has some highly useful functionality, e.g., its `read_csv()` function, `DataFrame` and `Series` data structures, and its ability to quickly filter/sort/edit data (which is particularly helpful when experimenting and exploring your data)."

    "The first step in any NLP pipeline is **tokenization**. Remember, tokenization is the process of taking a string of text (e.g. sentence, paragraph, document) and splitting it up into meaningful sub-units (e.g., words). This will allow models to process and understand text in the way that humans do -- i.e. one word at a time.\n",

However, for this first problem set, we find it most instructive to write the tokenizer from scratch. This will allow us to develop an appreciation of what takes place \"under the hood\" of these great libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our tokenizer will involve the following three steps:\n",
    "- **Lowercasing**: converts all text to lowercase (e.g. `\"The cat ate the fish.\"` -> `\"the cat ate the fish.\"`).  It will allow models to recognize that the first `\"The\"` in the sentence and the second `\"the\"` in the sentence are actually the same word.  \n",
    "- **Punctuation removal**: deletes punctuation (e.g. `\"the cat ate the fish.\"` -> `\"the cat ate the fish\"`) so that characters such as `\".\"`, `\"!\"`, `\"?\"`, etc. not recognized as part of any word. \n",
    "- **Whitespace-splitting**: takes a string of text and segments out the words as a list of strings based on whitespace (e.g. `\"the cat ate the fish\"` -> `[\"the\", \"cat\", \"ate\", \"the\", \"fish\"]`).  "

To quantify the distance between two documents, we will calculate the **cosine similarity** between their vector representations.

One easy way for Mooogle to recommend documents that are similar to $d$ is to find $k$ documents in the rest of the corpus that have the largest cosine similarity with $d$.

    "### Word Representations\n",
    "So far, we have only considered how vectors can encode similarity at the document level. However, for decades, researchers have aspired to have useful, meaningful _word-level_ representations, too. After all, much of human language is built on piecing together words that have individual, semantic meaning. Thus, it makes sense for models to also try to capture this phenomenon. In 2013, `word2vec` was created, and not only did it yield the most compelling word-level representations to date, but it was the first, main deep learning architecture in NLP that had undeniably strong results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### PyTorch\n",
    "Back in 2013, deep learning frameworks (e.g., Theono, Caffe, Torch) existed, but they were difficult to use and had orders of magnitude fewer users/contributors than today. With the power of modern-day PyTorch, we will train word-level representations from scratch on our full news corpus. As we will see, even though we are using a relatively small dataset, we will still be able to do some useful reasoning with the word vectors we obtain.  Part of the purpose of this problem is to introduce you to PyTorch's excellent abstractions (e.g. `Dataset`, `DataLoader`, `Module`, `Optimizer`, etc.). Thus, even though the `word2vec` model that we consider here is a simpler version than the ones provided in third-party libraries, our comprehensive, from-scratch approach is more scalable to future problem sets that involve more complex models (e.g. large language models, neural translation models) -- especially when GPUs are involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch is heavily object-oriented, which means that we will need to create our own versions of its classes in order to solve our specific problems.  You can find a refresher on object-oriented programming in Python [here](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/).   "

    "Let's start by defining a custom PyTorch dataset class for our news corpus. We will call it the `MooogleDataset`.  Notice in the cell below that it extends the base PyTorch `Dataset`. As a subclass of `Dataset`, `MooogleDataset` is required by contract to implement three methods (you can read more about this [here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/data_tutorial.html)):\n",
    "- A `__init__` method that inputs and stores all the instance variables needed for creating a particular `MooogleDataset` object. As an example, we have implemented this function for you below to take in three arguments:\n",
    "    - the dictionary `tokenized_texts`\n",
    "    - the dictionary `vocab`,\n",
    "    - and an integer `vocab_size`. This will limit the number of unique words that our model is exposed to by only considering the `vocab_size`-most frequent words. Having such a cutoff is standard in deep learning, so that models do not become too large. We will use `vocab_size = 5000`.  Feel free to modify/extend the code in `__init__` if you think that will make implementing the next two functions easier. **Pro tip:** whenever you start to write _any_ code, it's good practice to start small just to ensure everything interacts and behaves correctly -- only once you're sure of such is it worth scaling up and validating the quality of your code. \n",
    "- A `__len__` method that tells us how large the dataset is. In our case, this should be the number of documents in the corpus. You need to implement this method.\n",
    "- A `__getitem__` method that gets a particular item in the dataset. You need to implement this method. The input is `idx`, which is an integer between 0 (inclusive) and the length of the dataset determined by `__len__` (exclusive).  Given `idx`, we want `__getitem__` to (a) find the `idx`-th document (when the documents are sorted in order by id) and (b) return the *integer representation* of that document wrapped in a PyTorch [`Tensor`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html).  Words with vocabulary indices greater than `vocab_size - 1` are ignored. For example consider the document `[\"the\", \"cat\", \"ate\", \"the\", \"yummy\", \"fish\"]` with vocabulary `{\"the\": 0, \"ate\": 1, \"cat\": 2, \"fish\": 3, \"yummy\": 4}` and `vocab_size = 4`.  Then, the *integer representation* of the document is `[0, 2, 1, 0, 3]`, since \"the\"=0, \"cat\"=2, \"ate\"=1, \"the\"=0, \"yummy\"=3, and \"fish\"=2, but \"yummy\" is ignored (i.e., dropped) since its vocabulary index exceeds `vocab_size - 1`.\n",

    "Congrats on making it this far! Now comes the most fun part yet: **implementing the Word2Vec model**. Recall that in the [original Word2Vec paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3781.pdf), there were two ways that Word2Vec vectors could be trained (CBOW and skip-gram). We will be implementing the first method, called **Continuous Bag-of-Words** (CBOW). You can find a diagram of CBOW below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CBOW Training Algorithm:** We will train a vector (also called an \"embedding\") $x_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^D$ for each word $i$ in our vocabulary of size $V$, where $D = 100$ is the size of the vector. To train the embeddings, we will use the documents from our news corpus. Here's the overall process of what we will do:\n",
    "1. Assume we have a document $d$ of length $T$ represented by a sequence of words $w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_T$.  For each word $w_t$ in this document, we will try to predict $w_t$ based on its surrounding words (also known as its \"context\") $\\mathcal{C}_t = \\{w_{t - N}, \\ldots, w_{t - 1}, w_{t +1} \\ldots, w_{t + N}\\}$, where $N = 5$ denotes the context length (meaning the full context will include the 5 words that preceed our given word, and the 5 words that follow it).\n",
    "2. Compute the \"context embedding\" $x = \\frac{1}{2N} \\sum_{w \\in \\mathcal{C}_t} x_w$ by averaging the word embeddings of all words in the context.  Note that this averaging is done for each dimension of the embedding, so $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^D$.  Also note that this averaging will eliminate any notion of word order among words in the context, hence \"continuous bag-of-words\".   \n",
    "3. Use $x$ as the feature vector in a multi-class logistic regression (softmax) problem to predict the missing word $w_t$ out of $V$ possible words in our vocabulary. \n",
    "4. Optimize the word embeddings to minimize the logistic regression loss with batch gradient descent.\n",

    "To implement CBOW in PyTorch, we will extend the ``Module`` class (see below).  If you are new to PyTorch, it is expected that this part will be challenging, so don't worry if it takes you a lot of time to get a working implementation.  Definitely check out the excellent PyTorch tutorial on ``Module`` [here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/buildmodel_tutorial.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class='q_pink'><b>2.4d The CBOW Module [20 points]</b>\n",
    "    \n",
    "All models in PyTorch are implemented through the ``Module`` class.  Below, write a custom ``Module`` called ``CBOW`` that accomplishes the CBOW algorithm we outlined above. Note, every ``Module`` needs to implement the following two methods:\n",
    "1. An ``__init__()`` method that initializes the ``Module`` object.  This ``__init__()`` method typically involves three things: (a) Inputing and saving instance variables (similar to what we did in ``MooogleDataset`` above), (b) Defining the layers/architecture of the network based on these instance variables, and (c) Initializing the layers of the network. \n",
    "    - For ``CBOW``, we have supplied the signature of the ``__init__()`` method, which includes the instance variables you'll need (e.g. ``context_size``, ``vocab_size``, etc.); your job is to accomplish (a), (b), and (c).  For step (b), you can find a list of PyTorch layers [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html) [hint: check out ``Embedding`` and ``Linear`` in particular].  For step (c), you can find PyTorch functions for initializing tensors [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.init.html).  **We highly recommend initializing all word vectors as zero vectors and the logistic regression weights uniformly between -1 and +1.**    \n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "2. A ``forward()`` method that takes a `batch` of data from the `DataLoader` and returns a tuple of two tensors: (a) a tensor of predictions `preds` and (b) tensor of targets `targets`.  \n",
    "    - For ``CBOW``, the input `batch` is a 2D `LongTensor` (i.e. tensor of integers).  It has dimensions $B \\times T$, where $B$ is the batch size and $T$ is the sequence length (i.e. number of words).  Keep in mind that many rows in `batch` will end with a string of -1's to indicate padding.  \n",
    "    - The first output `preds` is expected to be a 2D `FloatTensor` (i.e. tensor of decimals) with dimensions $M \\times V$, where $M$ is the number of (non-pad) words in the batch and $V$ is the size of the vocabulary.  The $(i, j)$-th entry of `preds` will contain CBOW's predicted *log probability* of the $i$-th word in the batch being equal to the $j$-th word in the vocabulary.  \n",
    "    - The second output `targets` is expected to be a 1D `LongTensor` with length $M$.  The $i$-th entry of `targets` will contain the true identity (i.e. \"target\") of the $i$-th word in the batch.\n",
    "    - Writing a `forward()` method that goes directly from `batch` to (`preds`, `targets`) may be quite a challenging task, so we have broken down the problem into subproblems that may be easier to think about.  Each subproblem will involve implementing a different *helper function* (see cell below) that can be used to implement by full `forward()` method.  We encourage you to test your helper functions with sample inputs as you implement them [hint: recall that you can get a sample batch from any `DataLoader` object `dataloader` by running `batch = next(iter(dataloader))`].\n",
    "        - *Subproblem 1*: Following the **CBOW Training Algorithm** above, the first step is to take the batch of documents ``batch`` along with some integer ``context_size`` and extract a ``contexts`` tensor and a ``targets`` tensor.  This logic will be implemented in the ``split_data()`` helper function below [hint: you may want to make use of [this PyTorch function](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.Tensor.unfold.html) in your implementation].  Since each batch has multiple documents, each document has multiple contexts, and each context is comprised of multiple words, ``contexts`` will be a 3D tensor with dimensions $B \\times C \\times N$, where $C$ is the number of contexts [hint: $C$ is a function of $T$ and $N$].  The `targets` tensor will be a 2D tensor with dimensions $B \\times C$, since each context has one target word to predict.  In future steps, we will be using the ``contexts`` to predict the ``targets`` (think of ``contexts`` as the \"X-variable\" and ``targets`` as the \"y-variable\" in logistic regression).  \n",
    "        - *Subproblem 2*: The next step has more to do with tensor organization than the actual CBOW algorithm.  If you look inside your ``contexts`` and ``targets`` tensors from the previous subproblem, you'll notice that some of these contain $-1$, which corresponds to padding.  These exist because we needed to pad some of the documents in order to process them as a batch with common sequence length $T$.  However, we don't actually want to train our model on any contexts or targets that contain padding; padding has nothing to do with the CBOW algorithm.  Thus, to filter out the pads, you will flatten the 3D `contexts` tensor and 2D `targets` tensor by implementing the `flatten_tensors()` helper function below.  The outputs should be a flattened 2D `contexts` tensor with dimensions $M \\times N$ and a flattened 1D `targets` tensor with dimension $M$, where $M$ is the total number of real (i.e. non-pad) words in the batch [hint: to check your understanding, think about why it must be the case that $M < B \\cdot C$].\n",
    "        - *Subproblem 3*: Assuming that you have implemented both `split_data()` and `flatten_tensors()` correctly, you are now ready to write the `CBOW.forward` method, which will call both of these helpers.  The output of `flatten_tensors()` will yield `contexts` and `targets`.  Following the description of the **CBOW Training Algorithm** above, figure out how to pass `contexts` through the layers you defined in ``CBOW.__init__`` to yield ``preds``, the log probabilities tensor of size $M \\times V$.  Then, return ``preds`` and ``targets`` to finish the function.\n",

    "- Choosing a [loss function](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#loss-functions)\n",
    "- Writing a training loop (i.e. step 4 in the tutorial).  In the training loop, you'll have to set how many times to iterate through the dataloader; this is also called the *number of epochs*.  For starters, 1-2 epochs should be enough to see some decent results in the next section, but feel free to train for more epochs to see if you can get even better word vectors. **In your training loop, please print out your loss every 10 batches.** This is insightful to the user (and grader).\n",
